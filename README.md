# Still working on this page — sorry for the mess!

Here's a quick rundown of my public projects. No fancy README yet, just raw links and some honest context:

### 🔧 [CodeSim](https://github.com/vgomes-p/CodeSim)  
This one is getting wild. It’s my main focus right now (when I'm coding for fun).

### 🛍️ [Shoppy](https://github.com/vgomes-p/shoppy)  
Helped a friend with a college assignment and ended up improving it a bit. Not that impressive, but it’s something.

### 🐴 [Schoola](https://github.com/vgomes-p/schoola)  
Total "go horse" style. Sorry in advance for what your eyes will witness.

### ⚙️ [Coder-Auto-Start](https://github.com/vgomes-p/Coder-Auto-Start)  
An automation script I made... but don’t use because my laptop boots too fast for it to work properly 😅

### 🤷 [auto_push](https://github.com/vgomes-p/auto_push)  
Another automation I don’t use. Not sure why it’s still public?
